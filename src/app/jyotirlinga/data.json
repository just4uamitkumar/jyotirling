      "description": "Kedarnath, a popular Hindu temple, tucked away in the lap of Garhwal Himalayas, some 221 km from Rishikesh in Uttarakhand, is one of the twelve Jyotirlinga temples of Lord Shiva. Lying against the backdrop of the magnificent Kedarnath Mandir Range, at an altitude of 3580 meters, the splendid Kedarnath Dham is where the devotees come seeking the blessings of Lord Shiva. Kedarnath Mandir is said to have been constructed by Adi Shankaracharya in the 8th century A.D. The nearby flowing Mandakini River, mesmerizing vistas and splendid sceneries in the form of the snow-clad mountains, rhododendron forests, and salubrious environment make Kedarnath Dham Yatra, a tranquil and picturesque place to be at"

      "description": "The site of Somnath has been a pilgrimage site from ancient times on account of being a Triveni Sangam: the confluence of three rivers namely Kapila, Hiran and Saraswati. The Gurjara-Pratihara king Nagabhata II recorded that he has visited tirthas in Saurashtra, including Someshvara, an alternative name for the temple. In 1026, during the reign of Bhima I, the Turkic Muslim ruler Mahmud of Ghazni raided and plundered the Somnath temple, breaking its jyotirlinga. He took away a loot of 20 million dinars.  Kumarapala (r. 1143–72) rebuilt the Somnath temple in “excellent stone and studded it with jewels,” according to an inscription in 1169. He replaced a decaying wooden temple."

      "description": "Considered one of the holiest places for Hindus in India and one among the four Char Dham pilgrimage sites, Rameswaram is also the closest point to Sri Lanka from India. Geological evidences state that once India was connected to Sri Lanka from this point via the Rama Sethu bridge. This quaint town has from time immemorial been a place of great interest and admiration to travellers. It is believed that Lord Rama, on his return after his war with Ravana, offered a repentance prayer to Lord Shiva to absolve his sins he had to commit during the confrontation. One version suggests that the Shiv Linga or the idol in the temple was built as a part of his worship. Another version is that the Shiv Linga was built before his trip to Lanka. However, the temple and the tales that surround it has been a factor of popularity for the town."
